## 🏠 ALX Listing App

ALX Listing App is a modern property listing platform inspired by Airbnb, built to demonstrate a strong architectural foundation and a keen eye for design.

This repository currently holds the structural backbone of the project,the framework that will later evolve into a dynamic platform where users can view, filter, and manage property listings with ease.

💡 This project is designed to highlight clean code organization, component reusability, and scalable frontend architecture which are skills that matter in real-world development.

```🚀 Project Goal
The ALX Listing App aims to:

Build an Airbnb-style property listing interface with modern UI components.

Showcase clean frontend architecture using reusable components and modular design principles.

Lay a foundation for future integration of backend features such as authentication, dynamic data, and booking management.
